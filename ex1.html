<!-- Reacting to Events

A JavaScript can be executed when an event occurs, like when a user clicks on an HTML element.

To execute code when a user clicks on an element, add JavaScript code to an HTML event attribute:
onclick=JavaScript

Examples of HTML events:

    When a user clicks the mouse
    When a web page has loaded
    When an image has been loaded
    When the mouse moves over an element
    When an input field is changed
    When an HTML form is submitted
    When a user strokes a key. 
In this example, the content of the <h1> element is changed when a user clicks on it:-->
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html lang="en">
    <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8">
        <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
        <title>Document</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1 onclick="this.innerText='Ooops!'">Click This Text</h1>
    </body>
    </html>
