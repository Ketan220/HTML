JavaScript Function Object

In JavaScript, the purpose of Function constructor is to create a new Function object. It executes the code globally. However, if we call the constructor directly, a function is created dynamically but in an unsecured way.

    new Function ([arg1[, arg2[, ....argn]],] functionBody)  

Parameter

arg1, arg2, .... , argn - It represents the argument used by function.

functionBody - It represents the function definition.
